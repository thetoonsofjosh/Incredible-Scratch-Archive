# Incredible-Scratch-Archive
This is a large archive of most Scratch and Scratch-related program files (only those that are working and have been found) from Scratch 0.1 (2003) to Scratch 3.0 (2019), as well as some Scratch modifications. Some of these files, which are Squeak .image files, also need a Squeak runtime engine, which can be found here: https://squeak.js.org/run/ To use a Scratch version or modification that uses .image files, go to the link, and drag-and-drop the .image file of the Scratch version/mod. Then, to launch it, go to https://squeak.js.org/run/#image=thenameoftheimagefile.image&swapButtons=true, and replace "thenameoftheimagefile" with the name of the Scratch version/mod. If you get any errors, click "Abandon" on them. About .exe files: obviously, on Windows, just run them normally. However, if you're a Linux user like me, use a tool called Wine, the website of which, and where you can find more information about it, is here: https://winehq.org/ About .msi files: once again, just run them normally on Windows; on Linux, Wine also supports MISs: see the Wine Wiki's page about it here: https://wiki.winehq.org/Msiexec Also, if there are any Scratch mods I (for some reason) did not include, try searching "mod" site:https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/ on Google, and notifying me in a new issue (see the "Issues" tab at the top). About the "JPEXS FFDec" folder in this repository: This contains the necessary files to run the JPEXS FFDec application in Linux, MacOS, and Windows. This is useful to decompile and edit Scratch 2.0 .swf files to create Scratch 2.0 mods.

No rights or ownership is claimed of any of these files. All Scratch program files created by the MIT LLK Media Group.
